     * This is the query from the log miner view to get changes. Columns of the view are:
     *
     * SCN - The SCN at which a change was made
     * COMMIT_SCN - The SCN at which a change was committed
     * OPERATION - User level SQL operation that made the change. Possible values are:
     *      INSERT = change was caused by an insert statement
     *      UPDATE = change was caused by an update statement
     *      DELETE = change was caused by a delete statement
     *      DDL = change was caused by a DDL statement
     *      START = change was caused by the start of a transaction
     *      COMMIT = change was caused by the commit of a transaction
     *      ROLLBACK = change was caused by a full rollback of a transaction
     *      LOB_WRITE = change was caused by an invocation of DBMS_LOB.WRITE
     *      LOB_TRIM = change was caused by an invocation of DBMS_LOB.TRIM
     *      LOB_ERASE = change was caused by an invocation of DBMS_LOB.ERASE
     *      SELECT_FOR_UPDATE = operation was a SELECT FOR UPDATE statement
     *      SEL_LOB_LOCATOR = operation was a SELECT statement that returns a LOB locator
     *      MISSING_SCN = LogMiner encountered a gap in the redo records. This is most likely because not all redo logs were registered with LogMiner.
     *      INTERNAL = change was caused by internal operations initiated by the database
     *      UNSUPPORTED = change was caused by operations not currently supported by LogMiner (for example, changes made to tables with ADT c
     * USERNAME - Name of the user who executed the transaction
     * SRC_CON_NAME - Contains the pluggable database (PDB) name
     * SQL_REDO Reconstructed SQL statement that is equivalent to the original SQL statement that made the change
     * SEG_TYPE - Segment type. Possible values are:
     *      0 = UNKNOWN
     *      1 = INDEX
     *      2 = TABLE
     *      19 = TABLE PARTITION

     *      34 = TABLE SUBPARTITION
     *      All other values = UNSUPPORTED
     * TABLE_SPACE
     * STATUS - A value of 0 indicates that the reconstructed SQL statements as shown
     *          in the SQL_REDO and SQL_UNDO columns are valid executable SQL statements
     * OPERATION_CODE - Number of the operation code. Possible values are:
     *      0 = INTERNAL
     *      1 = INSERT
     *      2 = DELETE
     *      3 = UPDATE

     *      34 = MISSING_SCN
     *      36 = ROLLBACK
     *      255 = UNSUPPORTED
     * TABLE_NAME - Name of the modified table
     * TIMESTAMP - Timestamp when the database change was made
     * COMMIT_TIMESTAMP - Timestamp when the transaction committed
     * XID - Raw representation of the transaction identifier
     * XIDSQN - Transaction ID sequence number of the transaction that generated the change
